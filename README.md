# Vanilla JS version of the Sylver Coinage Combinatorics Game

See the game [description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylver_coinage). 


This Vanilla Web Application is the effective _game board_ for this game. It is built as a platform for solving [Problem 1](https://oeis.org/A248380/a248380.pdf) in John Conway's _Five $1,000 Problems_:

> ## Problem 1. ‘Sylver’ coinage game (named after Sylvester, who proved it terminates):
> The game in which the players alternately name positive integers that are not sums of
previously named integers (with repetitions being allowed). The person who names 1
(so ending the game) is the loser. The question is: If player 1 names ‘16’, and both 
players play optimally thereafter, then who wins?
